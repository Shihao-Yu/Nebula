# for now, it's okay to not implement the long-term conversation/log memory for our agent, we should still have short-term memory. but we will need to implement it later.

# Memory = The persistent log/history/data store that the agent can retrieve information from as needed.

# Past chat turns

# User profile, preferences, or embeddings

# Archived task results, file uploads, etc.

# Often large: Memory could be gigabytes—most isn’t loaded at once.

# Not always part of the current state: The state might contain references (e.g., “chat history id=42”) but not the full data.
